=======================================
THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK BONES: v0.1
=======================================
This is a small two week project I made in Uni based on the promopt, '10 Second Challenge'. Might follow up with this idea because I love Sherlock hehehe~

SUMMARY:
You are the world reknown dog detective "Sherlock Bones" (Sherlock Holmes), your mission is to solve the murder case before Detective Inspector Lebark (Lestrade) finishes his sentence in 10 seconds. To do this, you will need to 'inspect' clues by clicking on the flashing signs and figuring out the riddle.

HOW TO PLAY:
Basic point and click game, you will primary use the left mouse button to interact with things (escape key allows you to exit game).

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Pause time when solving puzzle
- Multiple aspects of the murder to solve (killer, victim, weapon, motive)
- Different types of puzzles (not just riddles)
